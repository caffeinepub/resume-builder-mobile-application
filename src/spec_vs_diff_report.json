  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented: the ResumeEditor placeholder is replaced with an editable form (title, personal info, summary) and save/cancel actions, and the page uses useGetResume/useUpdateResume from useResumes for offline-first persistence and sync. Some additional behavior changes in useResumes (e.g., resume list merging logic and query staleness tweaks) and toast notifications were introduced beyond the explicit request.",
