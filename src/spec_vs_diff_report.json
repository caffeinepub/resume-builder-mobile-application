  "summary": "Diff adds an Android-gated PWA install popup component wired to the existing usePwaInstall() flow, plus a localStorage-based dismissal cooldown hook, and mounts the popup in AppLayout. Overall, REQ-1/REQ-2/REQ-3 appear implemented based on the provided diff summary.",

      "description": "Added extra platform detection helpers (isIOS, isDesktop) that are not used by the popup gating logic and were not explicitly requested.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only requires limiting the popup to Android; implementing additional platform utilities beyond isAndroid is extra scope (though related).",
